# Expression Interpreter
* The interpreter takes in a parser as input. 
  
* The parser takes in a lexer as input. 
* The lexer takes in an expression as input. 
  
* Abstract syntax tree is used for
storing all the tokens generated by the lexer. 
  
* The interpreter uses post order traversal on the tree
to calculate the result.

* Tokens are the building blocks. 
* Operators supported are as follows: +, -, *, /, (, )

term: | factor((MUL/DIV)factor)*
factor: | INTEGER \| LPAREN expr RPAREN

* MINUS (-)
* MUL (*)
