Create an additional non-terminal factor for basic units of expression, in our case, integers.
The general rule is that if you have N levels of precedence, you will need N + 1 non-terminals in total:
one non-terminal for each level plus one non-terminal for basic units of expression.

R, defined in the grammar, becomes a method with the same name, and references to that rule become a method call: R().
